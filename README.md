## Vicky Gray

I'm an education professional turned junior developer. Enthusiastic, hard working, and with key strengths in teamwork, communication and attention to detail, I'm looking for a role with an organisation where I can continue learning and extending my skills.

#### Web Development

**Makers Academy**

Learning to code at Makers Academy, I have completed projects in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and AngularJS, amongst other technologies. It has meant I have an appreciation for clean code and test-driven development, and I have really enjoyed pair-programming with a different person every day. I has also meant I now have the ability to pick up new languages and frameworks very quickly, and I am still learning more!

Some projects completed include:
- [Danagotchi](https://github.com/vickymg/danagotchi "Danagotchi") - A mindfulness app using AngularJS
- [Museum Passport](https://github.com/vickymg/frontend_museum_passport "Museum Passport") - A mobile app for kids using Rails for the back end, and Ionic for the decoupled front end

**UCRecovery**

- I am now contributing to [UCRecovery](https://github.com/ezzye/ucrecovery "UCRecovery"), a collaborative project with Business Masters students at UCL to produce a data collection app, aimed at reducing post-operation recovery times in hospitals
- Ionic is being used as the main technology for this project, tested with Karma and Protractor, and as developers we are practising TDD and pair-programming

**Codebar**

- I currently volunteer as a coach at [Codebar](http://www.codebar.io/ "Codebar") programming workshops, teaching beginners to code

### Experience
