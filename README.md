#### Web Development Experience

**Ministry of Justice**

Junior Front-End Developer (August 2016 - present)

Working on front-end development in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently working on the Money to Prisoners project.

**Makers Academy**

Learning to code at Makers Academy, I have completed projects in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and AngularJS, amongst other technologies. It has meant I have an appreciation for clean code and test-driven development, and I have really enjoyed pair-programming with a different person every day. I also now have the ability to pick up new languages and frameworks very quickly, and I am always learning more.

Some projects completed include:
- [Danagotchi](https://github.com/vickymg/danagotchi "Danagotchi") - A mindfulness app using AngularJS
- [Museum Passport](https://github.com/vickymg/frontend_museum_passport "Museum Passport") - A mobile app for kids using Rails for the back end, and Ionic for the decoupled front end


**Teaching**

- I am an Assistant Instructor the Code First: Girls beginner HTML, CSS & JavaScript course at Birkbeck, University of London, for Autumn 2016
- I currently volunteer as a coach at [Codebar](http://www.codebar.io/ "Codebar") programming workshops, helping beginners learn to code
- I was also a coach at the most recent [Rails Girls London](http://railsgirls.london/ "Rails Girls London") workshop, taking beginners through Ruby basics, and getting a Rails app up and running
